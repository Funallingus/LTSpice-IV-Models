This is a collection of LTSpice IV models for various parts that I have created,
ported, edited, and/or organized. They generally reflect parts that I personally
use, and otherwise have no other clear theme. If it happens that I have a model
that you may need, then that is why I am providing this resource to you. Since
LTSpice is by Linear Technologies their default models reflects their parts
catalog and thus tends to be missing most everything else you may use by other
vendors. It is also somewhat difficult to find models specifically for LTSpice
but often times can be found for other Spice derivatives. Here is a parts
listing of the models I offer in this repository:
